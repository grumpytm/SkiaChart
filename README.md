# About the app
Simple chart with two lines that looks like the chart.png image using the SkiaSharp library.

### To do:
- [ ] update obsolete (TextSize, Typeface, DrawText and MeasureText) as per last SkiaSharp version
- [ ] create templates for the fonts, colors and whatnot used to make stuff easier to change
- [ ] make the mouse hover bubble to show the values
- [ ] overall refactor the code and get it closer to best practices and community standards
