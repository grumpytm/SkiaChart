# About the app
Simple chart with two lines created via the SkiaSharp library and based on this image:
![Alt text](images/chart.png?raw=true "Chart")

So far my result looks like:
![Alt text](images/sample.png?raw=true "Chart")

### To do:
- [ ] update obsolete (TextSize, Typeface, DrawText and MeasureText) as per last SkiaSharp version
- [ ] create templates for the fonts, colors and whatnot used to make stuff easier to change
- [ ] make the mouse hover bubble to show the values
- [ ] overall refactor the code and get it closer to best practices and community standards
