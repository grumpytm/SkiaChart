# About the app
Simple app to showcase a simple chart with two lines created with [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) library using this image as inspiration

![Alt text](Images/chart.png?raw=true "Chart")

so far my result looks like:

![Alt text](Images/sample.png?raw=true "Chart")

### To do:
- [x] update obsolete (TextSize, Typeface, DrawText and MeasureText) as per last SkiaSharp version
- [ ] create templates for the fonts, colors and whatnot used to make stuff easier to change
- [ ] make the mouse hover bubble to show the values
- [ ] overall refactor the code and get it closer to best practices and community standards
